title: Unsafe Object Creation Vulnerability in JSON (Additional fix)
date: 2020-03-19
description: |
  When parsing certain JSON documents, the json gem (including the one bundled
  with Ruby) can be coerced into creating arbitrary objects in the target
  system.

  This is the same issue as CVE-2013-0269. The previous fix was incomplete, which
  addressed `JSON.parse(user_input)`, but didnâ€™t address some other styles of JSON
  parsing including `JSON(user_input)` and `JSON.parse(user_input, nil)`.

  See CVE-2013-0269 in detail. Note that the issue was exploitable to cause a
  Denial of Service by creating many garbage-uncollectable Symbol objects, but
  this kind of attack is no longer valid because Symbol objects are now
  garbage-collectable. However, creating arbitrary objects may cause severe
  security consequences depending upon the application code.

  Please update the json gem to version 2.3.0 or later. You can use `gem update
  json` to update it. If you are using bundler, please add `gem "json", ">= 2.3.0"`
  to your Gemfile
patched_versions:
  - "~> 2.4.10"
  - "~> 2.5.8"
  - "~> 2.6.6"
  - ">= 2.7.1"
