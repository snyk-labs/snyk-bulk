title: Command injection vulnerability in Net::FTP
date: 2017-12-14
description: |
  There is a command injection vulnerability in Net::FTP bundled with Ruby.

  `Net::FTP#get`, `getbinaryfile`, `gettextfile`, `put`, `putbinaryfile`, and
  `puttextfile` use `Kernel#open` to open a local file. If the `localfile`
  argument starts with the pipe character `"|"`, the command following the
  pipe character is executed. The default value of `localfile` is
  `File.basename(remotefile)`, so malicious FTP servers could cause arbitrary
  command execution.

  All users running an affected release should upgrade immediately.
