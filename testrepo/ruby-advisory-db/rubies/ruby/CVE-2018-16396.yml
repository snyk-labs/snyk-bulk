title: Tainted flags not always propogated in Array#pack and String#unpack
date: 2018-10-17
description: |
  In `Array#pack` and `String#unpack` with some formats, the tainted flags of
  the original data are not propagated to the returned string/array.

  `Array#pack` method converts the receiverâ€™s contents into a string with
  specified format. If the receiver contains some tainted objects, the
  returned string also should be tainted. `String#unpack` method which
  converts the receiver into an array also should propagate its tainted flag
  to the objects contained in the returned array. But, with `B`, `b`, `H` and
  `h` directives, the tainted flags are not propagated. So, if a script
  processes unreliable inputs by `Array#pack` and/or `String#unpack` with these
  directives and checks the reliability with tainted flags, the check might be
  wrong.

  All users running an affected release should upgrade immediately.
