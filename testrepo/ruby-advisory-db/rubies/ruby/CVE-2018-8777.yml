title: DoS by large request in WEBrick
date: 2018-03-28
description: |
  There is a out-of-memory DoS vulnerability with a large request in WEBrick
  bundled with Ruby

  If an attacker sends a large request which contains huge HTTP headers,
  WEBrick try to process it on memory, so the request causes the out-of-memory
  DoS attack.

  All users running an affected release should upgrade immediately.
